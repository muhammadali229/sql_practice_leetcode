-- Question 15
-- The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. 
-- Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS employees_earning_more_than_managers;
USE employees_earning_more_than_managers;
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Salary int, ManagerId int);
Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '3');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '4');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', NULL);
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', NULL);

-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- | Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
-- | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
-- | 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
-- | 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. 
-- For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

    WHERE e.salary > m.salary
)
